# BigMart-Sales-EDA-and-Prediction
Bigmart is a big supermarket chain, with stores all around the country. The management of the shop decided to take help from data scientist to create a model that can predict the sales per product for each store. The shop had collected sales data of products across 10 stores in different cities over a given period of time. This is a supervised machine learning problem with a target label as: Item_Outlet_Sales. Also since we are expected to predict the sale price for a given product, it becomes a regression task.
